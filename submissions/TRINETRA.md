## Project Title

**Trinetra – AI Crowd Safety & Footfall Prediction System**

---

## Project Description

The project I created is **Trinetra**, an **AI-powered crowd safety system** that predicts **next-day footfall and crowd density** in high-traffic public spaces like **temples, fairs, and event venues**.

Using live video analysis and historical data, Trinetra forecasts crowd risk levels to **prevent stampedes** and **enable smarter crowd management**. It features:

* A **mobile app** (React Native) for real-time alerts and visual insights
* An **AI backend** that analyzes live camera feeds using **ResNet** for density estimation
* A **machine learning pipeline** built on **XGBoost** that predicts next-day crowd footfall and risk zones

Trinetra empowers authorities and event organizers with early predictions, ensuring **public safety, reduced congestion**, and **data-driven decision making**.

## Inspiration behind the Project

The inspiration for Trinetra came from frequent reports of **stampedes and overcrowding at religious places and public gatherings** in India.
During festivals, thousands gather at temples without accurate forecasting systems, leading to life-threatening chaos.

I wanted to create an AI system that could **see ahead of time** — predicting how dense a crowd might become the next day using **vision-based analytics** and **machine learning models**.
Trinetra’s mission is simple: *use AI to save lives by preventing stampedes before they happen.*
